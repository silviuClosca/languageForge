### Self-Assessment Guide

| Level | Reading | Listening | Speaking | Writing |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **1 - Beginner** | Recognize basic words | Catch a few familiar words | Struggle with basic phrases | Write simple words/phrases |
| **2 - Elementary** | Understand simple texts | Follow slow, clear speech | Express basic needs | Write short messages |
| **3 - Intermediate** | Read short articles | Understand main points in conversations | Discuss familiar topics | Write coherent paragraphs |
| **4 - Upper-Intermediate** | Comprehend complex texts | Follow fast native speech | Express ideas fluently | Write detailed texts |
