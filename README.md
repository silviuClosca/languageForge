## Data & Privacy

FluencyForge stores all of its user data locally in JSON files under:

```
fluencyforge_data/
```

These files contain:
- tracker history  
- radar snapshots  
- goals  
- settings  
- resources  

Notes:
- These files are **specific to your machine and Anki profile**.  
- The repository includes a `.gitignore` entry so `fluencyforge_data/` is **not tracked in Git**.  
- On first run, FluencyForge will automatically create any missing JSON files with sensible defaults.

If distributing this add-on:
- Keep `fluencyforge_data/` empty (or omit it).  
- Let each user generate their own data locally.
